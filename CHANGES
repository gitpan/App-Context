VERSION 0.966
 x add SharedDatastore as a useful service (with a Repository-based implementation)
 x improved support for "temporary" services (named "temporary" or with the {temporary} arg)
   (a "temporary service" is akin to a stateless session bean in Java)

   the %$options hash or when a particular named service is instantiated

VERSION 0.963
 x App->use() now detects entries in the symbol table to inhibit an attempt to load the module
 x enhance App::Service::substitute() to understand default syntax (i.e. {username:NULL})

   I don't remember what 0.962 was all about (minor)

VERSION 0.961
 x add per-module (subversion) $VERSION numbers

VERSION 0.96
 x added &App::in_debug_scope and &App::debug_indent()

   * print 'undef' instead of '' for undefined values in traces
   * made trace behave better with newlines. added trace_justify.
   * fixed a trace leak (return without sub_exit())
   * trace and debug scopes can now be exclusive (i.e. --trace=!App::Context,App::Context::Cmd)
 x log enhancements
   * added log levels (and optional args to log())
 x {temporary} widgets
 x add permissions to widget display from URL and method calls, also {open_widget_urls} option
 x add App::Service::substitute()
 x default dates can be {today}+6

VERSION 0.95
